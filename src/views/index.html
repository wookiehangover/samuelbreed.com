        <p>
            Hi <code>:wave:</code> My name is Samuel Breed and I build systems, usually with software and humans.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>What does that mean?</em> I work with teams to build software systems for businesses, friends, well-wishers, startups, open source projects, harmless pranks, and the public good ever since I first arrived here (on the Internet) as a youngster.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was 11 I wanted to learn how to build websites. Now I get to do it for a living. Pretty cool, <code>IMO</code>! I wanted to get paid to skateboard and make movies too, but neither of those have panned out yet the way software has. But software is more than just websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent the first 10 years learning about computers and not really understanding them very much. I learned how to customize html on Geocities and Angelfire, and later LiveJournal and MySpace, and later still Blogger and Wordpress. I had tried programming, first C, then Python, and finally a Java class in High School but nothing really stuck. Eventually I found out about Linux and a whole new universe of playing around with computers opened up in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few years later I got serious and learned enough PHP and JavaScript to get paid to update a few websites. Software is actually made of humans, working together, actively in collaboration or passively through the giant shoulders of modern software stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, I manage a small team running a web platform and managing build tooling for around 100 front end and native app developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I've had the pleasure of gainful employment at a number of different businesses:

            <li>American Apparel, 2007-2009</li>
        </ul>

                Not to harp on the boring details, but I have some opinions about web publishing:
            </p>
            <p>
                I did not use a complex tool to make this website. I specifically chose to eschew the modern dev tool chains, blogging platforms, and web frameworks because I think that there's a simplicty of an html document that's easily forgotten and rarely appreciated. I'm not judging other techniques for publishing things on the web, but it's worth pointing out that the old ways still work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not having a build step or a line of <code>JavaScript</code> was beyond compare. But writing anything complex like this would be too hard. I scaled the barrier to enter this easy world of minimalist web authoring more than 20 years ago in a <code>textarea</code> on Geocities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have the pleasure of working with those types of tools regularly. Writing this in a single <code>html</code> file was a joy. Writing only 4 lines of <code>CSS</code> for this website was delightful.
